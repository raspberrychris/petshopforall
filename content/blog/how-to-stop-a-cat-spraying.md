You may notice that your cat is behaving differently but don’t know why.  It’s important to watch out for changes in behaviour no matter how subtle, because there may be underlying health issues.  So I’m taking a look at some common cat behaviour problems.

## Cat spraying

Urine spraying is quite common especially for outdoors cats that use it as a method of controlling their territory.  It’s easy to spot the difference between a cat urinating normally and one who is spraying.  A spraying cat will stand as (opposed to stooping as it would normally to urinate) with its tail standing right up and will spray just a tiny amount up against bushes, fences or gateposts, in fact pretty much anywhere.

Of course you probably don’t mind where your cat sprays outdoors, but I’m quite certain if your cat sprays indoors it’s going to grab your attention.  This isn’t normal behaviour and can often be a sign that your cat feels insecure or stressed.

Both male and female cats are capable of spraying but it is way more common in males. By the way neutering will reduce male cats spraying by 90% and close to 95% for females.  I had a problem a few years ago with a cat spraying in my home and the reason behind it turned out to be a very common cause of indoor cat spraying.

It was simply due to the number of cats in the household.  What I didn’t know back then was that the number of cats you have in your house is a major factor in the likelihood of cat spraying occurring.  With just a single cat (neutered) the chance of this happening is about 5 to 10%, pretty good odds right?  Check this out though, lets say as an example you had 7 cats then the odds of cat spraying taking place rises to a staggering 80 to 90%.

## How to stop cat spraying

With young cats and normal cat spraying (to mark territory for example), then the solution is straight forward.  Neutering will decrease the amount of spraying as stated above.  With an older cat spraying about the house may be stress related or possibly illness related. Have a think about where you live, has anything changed recently?  The introduction of more cats, or anything that has altered the normal routine of your cat can cause anxiety or stress.

Also be aware of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD).  This can cause inappropriate urination but that is not the same thing as spraying.  FLUTD is a very common cat disease and can be serious.

Stop cat scratching furniture

Cats will often drag their claws down objects such as trees or wooden posts in order to maintain their claws.  The act of scratching removes the old worn outer shell and reveals a nice new sharp claw.

It can also be used in a territorial way, the pads on their paws leave behind a scent in the same way spraying urine does.

The problem is that an indoor cat will still want to carry out maintenance on its claws, so tables, wallpaper, carpet and chairs may all be targets.  Generally this is absolutely normal behaviour even though it may annoy the heck out of you, however if the scratching is widespread throughout the house then there may be an underlying issue.  It could be your cat feels insecure or that something is causing stress. (More about stress below).

## What can I do to stop my cat scratching?

There are many different products you can but from straight forward scratching posts to a whole mini playground for your cat.  Try placing scratch posts in the same location as where the cat usually scratches.

## Why does my cat bite me?

Cats are by their very nature hunters and can sometimes be aggressive.  It’s quite normal for cats to play fight with each other and with their owners.
One of my cats aged 5 loves to lie on his back looking all cute, and then when my hand touches his chest he bites the loose skin between my thumb and first finger whilst raking my arm with his back claws.  He’s just playing and never draws blood, although I think he enjoys the experience more than me.

This raises an interesting point though.  If you play fight like that with a kitten, using your bare hand you may find you end up training your kitten to attack any bare body part it sees.  In later life it may end up pouncing on bare feet for the fun of it, which may seem funny now but can become a real problem.  It’s better to use toys that have things on the end of sticks that you can make or buy.

There is a big difference between play fighting and true aggression towards a human.  There are many possible reasons a cat would be aggressive.

- Boredom
- Frustration
- Stress or anxiety
- Fear
- Pain or illnesses

You need to ask yourself ‘what’s changed’ is there anything in your house that’s different.  Are there any new additions, people or other animals?  Or consider that your cat might be in pain through an illness, even something as simple as ear ache or tooth ache.

## Why do cats bite when being affectionate?

A cat is naturally always very aware of its surroundings, always alert for any possible danger.  Therefore your cat will generally speaking not allow itself to become too relaxed.  Cats like to be stroked, it similar to their mother licking them as a kitten, but there comes a point when the cat decides that it’s had enough.  There are usually warning signs.  The cat will stop purring, its tail may flick from side to side and its body may stiffen, miss these signs and you may well get bitten.
 
## Feline stress

Stress is often found to be the root cause of many behavioural problems and can be an underlying problem related to some diseases.  The problem is that cats don’t really show their emotions outwardly like a dog does.  It is the subtle changes in their behaviour that you need to look out for.

Cats are like humans in as much as their ability to deal with stress differs from one individual to the other.  How they cope and how susceptible they are to stress is influenced by factors like their upbringing and their surroundings.
One thing is for sure though, cats are not good at dealing with prolonged periods of stress, so spotting that fact your cat may be stressed and finding out why quickly is important.
 
## There are 2 types of stress.

**Acute** – This type of stress is brought on suddenly by things such as a loud noise or the imminent threat of a fight with another cat.  This type is normal and the cat won’t be stressed for very long.  It’s quite easy to spot this type of feline stress by looking at your cats posture.

Crouched ready for action, be that to escape or fight.  Ears folded back flat against the head  Eyes wide open  

**Chronic** – This type of feline stress is much harder to spot and usually builds up over time.  The signs are usually quite subtle, but look out for any change in behaviour or routine, however small.

A change in eating habits, eating more or eating less.Urinating in places other than the litter tray/box.  Not interested in playing or lack of energy.Keeping out of the way, hiding under the bed.  Unusual aggression.

## What causes this kind of feline stress?

In truth many things can cause and contribute to your cats stress.  If the cat population where you live is particularly high than other cats can be the cause.  Factors inside your home can also contribute, like not having enough privacy or boredom.  Remember also that cats are very choosy about the amount of contact they want from us humans, they need their space.

Cats like routine, the time they are fed, the time you go and return from work, the amount of people and animals in the house.  Factors like toys, scratching posts and the amount of water bowls about the house can also have an effect.

## Your relationship with your cat

Getting the relationship right isn’t always easy.  Like it or not, the amount of contact you have with your cat is really up to your cat.  As a general rule of thumb always try and let your cat initiate contact rather than the other way around.  Some cats are just more sociable than others.
