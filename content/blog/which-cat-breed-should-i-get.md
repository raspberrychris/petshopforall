## Which cat breed should I get?  

You may want to consider one of the cats below, as we look at 5 popular domestic cat breeds and some of the characteristics and health problems associated with them.

## Siamese cat

Siamese cats were originally from Thailand (which was previously known as Siam).  Back
in the 20th century the Siamese cat became one of the most popular cat breeds in Europe and North America. 

The cat has been recognised for a number of notable things.  Siamese cats are very social; they are intelligent and affectionate, often forming a strong relationship with only one person.  They can be very vocal and even as adults they remain quite playful.

One unfortunate problem with Siamese and Siamese-derived cat breeds is that they have one of the highest mortality rates compared to other domestic cat breeds.  Their average life span is about 12.5 years.  

Some of the main causes of death include neoplasms and breast tumours.  The Siamese cat is also prone to digestive problems, however they are resistant to feline urinary tract condition, which is very common in most other cat breeds.

## Turkish Angora

Turkish Angora, as the title indicates, is an old pure breed that owes its origin to the Ankara region of Turkey.  The breed is often referred to as Ankara or Angora.  The most remarkable thing about this cat is that it has been around (documented) since the early 1600’s.  The Turkish Angora has a long silky coat on a sinuous body and is usually coloured tabby or tabby and white.

Turkish Angora cats are often energetic, smart and athletic.  They bond easily with us humans, although they will often bond better with one family member than the others and can be quite protective over that person.  It’s also really worth adding that they are easy to train, maybe due to their intelligence or perhaps the fact that they like to interact with us more than most other breeds.

The Angoras white coat and blue eyes are caused by the ‘W’ gene; this gene unfortunately is also responsible for hearing problems.  A cat with one blue eye will sometimes be deaf in the ear that is on the same side as the blue eye.  If the cat has two blue eyes then it can sometimes be completely deaf.  Having this gene does not affect all cats of this breed with hearing issues, only some.

One of the main health issues in this breed affects kittens.  Hereditary ataxia is a condition causing kittens to shake; sadly kittens with Ataxia will not make it to adulthood.

One further health issue worth a mention is Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart problem that particularly affects male Angoras aged between 2 and 6 years old.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is overall a very rare condition for the breed as a whole though.
 
## Ragdoll

The Ragdoll is an American breed that was created by Ann Baker.  It is one of the lager domestic cat breeds; in fact males can weigh up to 20 lbs! 

The Ragdoll has a very docile temperament and can become quite floppy when handled, hence the breed’s name.  Because of their docile nature they make great lap cats, despite their size.

Ragdolls are generally one of six different colours, chocolate, red and seal.  The other three colors are the ‘dilute’ versions of those colours giving us cream, blue and lilac. 

In addition to that there are also are four pattern types: van, mitted, bi-color and colorpoint.

Taking all the common domestic cat breeds into consideration then the Ragdoll has the poorest survival rates of all.  Over 60% of Ragdolls will only live until approximately 10 years old, and this breed is significantly affected by kidney and lower urinary diseases.  A significant factor in the poor life span of the Ragdoll is the amount of inbreeding, around the 40% mark.
 
## Pixie-bob

Pixie-bob is a uniquely American breed, founded by Carol Ann Brewer from Washington.  They have been bred so as to resemble the North American Bobcat, hence the name.  The average weight of a Pixie-bob is 10-11 lbs although some males will exceed this. 

Colours vary but often a Pixie-bob will be a tawny to reddish colour with small brown spotting.  They can be either long or short haired having a thick, almost wooly textured coat.

The Pixie-bob is considered to be a highly intelligent and very sociable breed.  They are quite vocal making growls, chirrups and chatter sounds but one very notable point is that they very rarely meow, in fact some individuals ‘never’ meow.  They make a great family cat due to their friendly playful nature; they are almost doglike in their loyalty to their owners and family.

The Pixie-bob is one of the hardiest domestic cat breeds due to the breed as a whole being genetically very diverse.  This means that the health problems that many other breeds suffer from due to inter breeding are almost entirely avoided by the Pixie-bob.
 
## Manx

The Manx is a breed of domestic cat that originated from the Isle of Man.  The cat has many different characteristics, most notably the lack of a tail.  The breed has extended hind legs and a round head; it is considered a small to medium sized breed.  The Manx is usually short haired and can come in a multitude of colours although completely white versions are very rare but do exist.

The cat is a renowned hunter and would be very useful for anyone with rodent problems.  The Manx is a gregarious and sociable cat making a great companion for children.  The cat is also known to be remarkably smart and playful; in fact the Manx is very ‘dog like’ in its characteristics.  Although I said how sociable this breed is, the Manx cat is quite wary of strangers.  Personally I consider this to be a good thing.

The main health issues for this breed stem from the Manx taillessness gene.  A tailless cat can only carry one copy of this gene because a cat having two copies almost always leads to miscarriage. This is why Manx breeders will avoid breeding two Manx cats that are entirely tailless.

A further issue with the Manx gene is that in adult cats the tail vertebrae can become arthritic which can obviously become painful for the cat.  Therefore the majority of Manx breeder will have the kittens tail docked around day 4 of its life.
Thirdly we have Manx Syndrome; this is when the spine is shortened too much due to the tailless gene.  This can cause problems to the digestion, bladder and bowls of the cat which can result in sudden death or more usually will result in an early death at around 3 to 4 years.
