This product is actually the fat from the kidneys of a cow. In fact you may be able to get this from you local grocer’s meat counter.

Perhaps one of the most important things you will need when you take up the hobby of bird watching is the binoculars. Bird watching binoculars can make the difference between seeing a flurry of movement and identifying a rare species to add to your list. The best equipment can be a costly item, but you don’t need a lot of other equipment to fully enjoy your hobby, so finding the right binoculars is worth the price.

If you’ve wondered about the numbers that are used in descriptions of binoculars, they are quite simple. The numbers will look something like 8�42 or 7�35. The first number is the amount of magnification. A 7x lens makes items look seven times closer. 10x binoculars make birds appear ten times closer. Many birders, particularly those who use the tool in varied conditions will choose an 8x set.

The second part of the number is the diameter of the larger lens expressed in millimeters. Larger lens allow more light to enter the instrument so that you can see detail more clearly. Choosing a much larger lens means a heavier and bulkier set of binoculars, so they may not be as desirable for a backpacking trip. The preferred range is between 35mm and 50mm.

Two main types of prism design are available in bird watching binoculars. The porro prism has the outer lens offset from the eyepieces, so the light path follows a z-shaped pattern. These binoculars are wider but less durable than the roof prism type. Roof prisms are placed so that the binoculars are very streamlined. They are also significantly more expensive. Veteran birders usually recommend purchasing the roof prism design if you can afford the cost.

Ease of focusing the binoculars is very important when you are changing viewing distances. Birds can move very quickly and you want to be able to follow a flight path without the necessity of turning the focus more than one full revolution. The focusing screw should be located between the eyepieces so that it can be operated with the one index finger

Advanced technology has made it possible to find quality, lightweight binoculars. Usually a few ounces won’t make much difference in the comfort of using them. Be sure that the binoculars you choose are well balanced front to back or you will notice wrist strain after lengthy use.

These are just a few of the major features in a good pair of bird watching binoculars. You should also check the lens coating and the comfort of the eye cups. If you have special vision needs, you may need a higher priced model in order to be able to fully enjoy your hobby.
