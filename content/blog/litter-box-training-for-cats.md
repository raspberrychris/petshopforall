## Litter Box Training

Most cats you get from a shelter or pet store are already litter box trained, but kittens need to learn to use the box and adult cats can often regress from using the box for one reason or another.

## Older cats

Most older cats have been trained and prefer to use the litter box since cats naturally tend to bury their urine and waste.  An older cat that doesn’t use the box may be experiencing physical or emotional problems that is causing them to act up in this way.

For example, too much commotion in the home suddenly can make a cat nervous about using the litter box.  They may actually be afraid of moving through the house to get to their box at all.  This too may be their way of rebelling against you or acting out, the way a teenager may rebel by purposely missing curfew.  Or it may be nerves working overtime if they’re literally frightened or traumatised. 

Consider if you’ve had a recent visit from rambunctious family members or friends.  Other changes in the home that often bring about these rebellions or reactions in a cat include new animals in the house, the owner being gone for prolonged periods of time, or a move to a new home.

Urinary tract infections and other physical problems can give them difficulties in holding their urine or feces, just like a human might have difficult with bladder control problems as well.  A trip to the vet is always in order when there have been no changes in the home and the cat suddenly exhibits this type of behaviour.

## Cleaning the litter

Very often cats will avoid the litter box when it’s not cleaned properly.  Even though they’re animals, cats don’t care to defecate or urinate in an area that’s already crowded with waste.

Remember that cats have a very sensitive sense of smell.  You may assume the litter box is clean because you’ve removed much of the solid waste but to a cat it can still seem very dirty.  It’s important to keep the litter box clean to your cat’s standard, not yours. 

## Here are some things to consider:

Solid waste and wet areas of the litter should be scooped out every single day and disposed of away from the litter area.Fresh litter should be at least an inch and a half deep.The box itself should be washed out once per week with soap and hot water.  Add some vinegar or lemon juice to the water as you wash it to remove all traces of the odour of urine.Pet supply stores sell plastic linings for litter boxes and this might help to keep them clean. 

However even if you use them be sure to wash the box once per week anyway so all traces of odour are removed.Do not use ammonia when you clean the litter box as ammonia smells quite a bit like urine and can actually turn your cat away from the box.If you do not keep the box clean your cat is less likely to use it and will be more likely to relieve himself in other areas of the home. 

Consider how quickly and thoroughly you clean up other places where a cat relieves himself; that area is clean and odour-free, so of course he’ll want to use it over and over again!  Which would you prefer, a spotless bathroom that’s cleaned every day or one that’s obscenely filthy? 

Cats prefer something clean for their own bathroom habits, so be sure you’re providing it for them.

## Other important tips for litter box training

Remember that cats can find the litter box unpleasant because of something nearby.  For kittens especially that are still timid about everyday household items, they may find the washing machine or dryer somewhat scary – and yet many people keep the litter box in the laundry room!

Nearby cleaning supplies and solutions can also be overwhelming when it comes to their odour, turning a cat away from it.  If your box is in a closet, basement, laundry room or other area where there are cleaning supplies or other items with a strong odour, this can be turning your cat off to using it.

Sprinkle some baking soda into the litter when you change it as this can help with odour control as well.  Don’t overwhelm the box with baking soda as it may get between their toes which they in turn need to lick off.

It’s also important to make sure your cat has unencumbered access to the box at all times.  If there’s a door between the cat and the box, be sure that it stays open.  Older cats and kittens may find a long journey into a basement somewhat difficult so consider keeping it closer to their main living area.

Owners often forget that cats also like some privacy for doing their business.  Putting the box in an area that’s typically busy can make it difficult for them.  You can purchase a cover for your box or better yet, move it to an area with less foot traffic.
Cats also do not like to relieve themselves where they eat or even where you eat or prepare food.  A box off the kitchen may be uncomfortable to them even if it’s technically in the laundry room or landing to the basement stairs. 

## Consider moving it to a bathroom area instead

If you notice your cat avoiding the litter box and you cannot clean it as often as you should, provide more than one box.  This is a good thing to do if you notice the cat relieving himself in areas of the house or if he’s urinating in the box but defecating elsewhere in the house – once he urinates, the box may be too dirty for him to use.  Putting two litter boxes out for his use may take care of this problem since they’ll be cleaner than just the one.

As with all other parts of cat training, litter box training requires patience and commitment from the owner, and also requires you doing your own part in keeping the box clean and available to them.  Cleaning out the litter box is no one’s favourite job but it is part of responsible pet ownership.
