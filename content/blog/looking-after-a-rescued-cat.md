## Looking after a Newly Rescued Kitten

When your new rescued kitten is home, the kitten as well as all your family has to get accustomed to each other.  A kitten is tiny, as well as it’s inquisitive about everything and so regardless of where you might be at any instant.

The kitten could possibly be right behind you, in front of you, or attempting to climb up your leg!

In order to get through the transition period without becoming a bundle of nerves, the smartest thing that can be done with the kitten as well as yourself is to create a secure area.

This can be a area where you’ll be able to put the kitten so you’re confident he’s safe as well as not likely to get stepped on. A place where kitty  knows he’ll be out of harm’s way from getting injured!

Any large cardboard box will do.  Arrange the inside in the box so that there are specific areas for specific things, for example a sleeping place, some paper to go potty on (if there’s room for a temporary litter tray inside there all the better!).  A supply of fresh water that’s not easily knocked over.

In addition give the kitten some small toys to play with so he doesn’t get bored. This turns into sort of a toddlers playpen. It’s where you’re certain he’s safe and sound.
As with a toddler however, kittens are  going to try to get out of the box, especially after the novelty on the box is gone and has been fully explored.
He’ll take a leap for the top of the box, consequently make sure that you use a box that’s fairly heavy and won’t fall over.  

If he manages to hang over the top of it,  don’t make it so high that if he does manage to get to the top and fall out, he’s not likely to harm himself.

## A Rescued kitten needs a safe place

You could lay a pillow at the base of the side most likely to be the “escape route” just in case. You also should situate the box in a shady corner, from sunlight, as well as out of the way of long curtains.

If he can he’ll make a leap for your drapes and try to escape that way!

Despite the escaping opportunity, this safe and sound place provides you with peace of mind, especially in the early days when you’re still adjusting to having him around.
It will offer him someplace of his own to come back to once he’s had enough of the “big” world inside your house.

Though he may want to escape the box, there’ll be other times when all of it will get a tad much. He will enjoy his own space and actual sit beside his safe and sound area, and attempt to jump in!

Rescued kittens are no different than us humans, they need their space ! Thanks for visiting Rescued Cat health.

## Facts About Cats - Emotional Assistance Animals

## Basic Facts About Cats

When you are petting and holding your cat you can feel the emotions, the therapy you are receiving. Some facts about cats are that they provide a calming and comforting feeling. It is hard to describe to someone that isn’t a cat owner. Cats are used in hospitals for that same calming and healing. Providing patients with emotional health and a sense of well-being.

Yet more cat info is they have another purpose. Helping our war veterans cope with (PTSD) “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.”

PTSD produces some very unique conditions. Experiencing the traumas of war, can give the veteran a high degree of anxiety. Causing the vet to be over-reactive and hyper-vigilant. A veteran with PTSD can be hyper-aware of a situation that would be considered normal to us. Cats have a unique potential to help with these illnesses.

## Cats and observant

One of the trait cats have is they are one of the most observant animals. They can provide PTSD patients with a sense of security. If the cat doesn’t react to a specific situation, than the vet knows everything is OK.

Psychiatrist’s are now prescribing emotional assistant cats as recovery plans for veterans with this illness.

There have been case studies done and they show some amazing results. In one study, when the veteran became uneasy. The cat sensed these feelings and would cuddle and lay on the veterans lap, letting  him know everything was all right.

If the soldier is having a bad night? The cat will wake him up and provide a sense of security. This study shows that cats can be trained to notice subtle changes in the veterans demeanor and also in his environment and react positively. We always knew how intelligent they are!

Considering cats can adapt relatively well to many different environments. Cats are showing they have specific characteristics for these particular health problems.
Besides providing assistance for patients in hospitals and war veterans, cats most important therapy is with the average person right at home. House Cats provide us with their soothing and calming therapy every single day. Just some more facts about cats.

## Cat Diseases for Elderly Cats

Cat diseases are a concern especially with the average indoor cat living 15 to 18 years, and some  living into their 20s. Becoming older has the inevitable risks of  sickness and disease. Because cats hide their sickness by nature, sometimes it is hard to pin point the problem.

It is important to notice the slightest change in behavior, if you don’t act quickly the cat ailments can turn critical in a short amount of time.

Weight loss in cats, especially in an elderly cat, should never be ignored, there are many cat health problems that can contribute to weight loss. A cat that still has good body weight and health is likely to respond better to  treatment.

A cat vomiting frequently should not be considered normal. Frequent vomiting is a gastrointestinal problem that can be treated. Vomiting can indicate serious issues such as liver, kidney, dental disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and even cancer. Senior cat diseases are inevitable but, should be closely monitored.

## What Diseases can cats get?

There are many diseases cats can get.  **Hyperthyroidism** in cats is very common. The thyroid gland controls the amount of hormones and how fast the metabolism functions. The increased hormones increases activity  and makes the animal irritable and anxious.
The cats appetite has also increased, but is losing weight and drinking more fluids. This increases their litter box trips and increases accidents. Feline hyperthyroidism can also cause liver disease and life-threatening high blood pressure.

**Chronic renal disease** could be another cause of rapid weight loss. If the cat is losing appetite, vomiting repeatedly, drinking more and increasing urination. This disease is a slow irreversible deterioration of the kidneys, which is detected with blood work and urine samples.

Switching to a low-protein diet and medications prescribed by your vet can help with this cat diseases.

**Hypertension** (high blood pressure) can cause seizures, strokes, cognitive problems, aggression. If left untreated can cause blindness and damage organs including the heart, kidneys, and the brain. If you notice your cats eyes dilating, bring him to the vet immediately.

Hypertension is usually related to other diseases such as, thyroid or kidney disease. Once you treat the underlying disease, the hypertension usually goes away.

**Obesity** in older cats  can cause a number of cat health problems such as, diabetes, respiratory distress, arthritis, urinal tract disease. Crash diets are not the way to go here. Losing weight to quickly, could trigger fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis), a potentially deadly disease. Minor reductions in diet and added exercise are a good way to reduce your cats weight.

Cat nutrition for older felines is essential. Research on the Internet for recommendations for a balanced diet, but always consult with your vet. Any changes in their regular diet should be gradual. Feed your senior cat three or four small meals a day to help increase digestive availability, with plenty of fresh water for healthy kidneys.

It's important to watch for elderly cat diseases and any changes in behaviour, increases or decreases in appetite, excessive drinking and urination, any unusual behaviour should be a cause for alarm.

## How Loyal are Cats?

Many experts say that cats are loyal and independent animals and don’t require much human intervention.  These very same experts state their reason to associate with humans is due to their strategy of survival.  Although I agree this is partly true, they also seek our compassion and companionship. Many myths and misconceptions are from people who haven’t realised yet that - Cats are the perfect pet!

Most people who have owned a cat will tell you that cats are great at bonding with people, although they are very particular.  Normally, a cat will choose someone in the home that he bonds with.  You’ll know when a cat wants to bond with you, as he will seek your attention or snuggle up to you at night when you are sleeping.  Purring is a strong sign of affections, especially with cats that are happy and content.

Experts have tried to figure it out, no one really knows why cats choose a particular person that they will bond with.  It could be the individual’s manners, voice, or simply how that person treats the cat or it could be something in the cats natural instincts.  Perhaps it may be the individual is really gentle, or maybe a little more forceful – bringing the best out in the cat.

There are a lot of ways that researchers have tried to pin point this subject, one of which being psychic.  Some say that cats bond with someone due to a “psychic aura” that is compatible with both the person and the cat.  If a cat feels that someone is giving them a bad vibe, they will simply ignore that person.  Although this can be true to a sense for some, a majority of those who own cats will tell you that this couldn’t be any further from the truth.

In reality no one really knows why cats bond with humans.  There’s little  proof available as well, other than cats and their natural instinct for physical survival and their need for a  home. Contrary to the independent belief, we know that cats crave attention, simply to make them feel needed.  They love to be pampered by their owners, and will shower you with attention and affection if you just give them the love and attention that they justly deserve.

New cat owners may find bonding to be very different. They are different from other pets, including dogs, in the sense that they bond in their own way. Different breeds have different personalities and will bond differently with their owners, although most prefer affection and attention.

The more time you spend around your cat, the more he will bond with you.  Over the years, you’ll find that the bond you create with your pet has grown very strong and will be their for the entire life of your pet – and simply cannot be broken.

Growing up my family always had dogs for pets, which make great pets. After our first cat rescue we were sold on these little guys. Now after many years of cat ownership ,we now know one thing- Cats are the most loyal and make the best pets!! Rescued cat health is your online feline info centre.

## Cats are very affectionate

Cats are wonderful creatures they are affectionate, loyal, and filled with love. It isn’t out of the ordinary to see a cat in just about every other home, sleeping in the window or cuddling with their owners.

They were domesticated some 5,000 years or so ago. The  valley of the Nile was the first recordings of domestication, which is what research tells us today.
In the first encounters people were very grateful to cats and encouraged them to stay with them by feeding them scraps of food. Once they were fed and perceived humans to be no threat, the cats would move in permanently with their human owners.
As time went by, even the wildest of cat would allows humans to approach him, often times even hold and touch as well.

In early days, cats were very loyal and endearing pets. They were  great hunters, as they did their sleeping in short periods and were much easier to wake up than dogs. Cats also have better night vision than dogs, and much better hearing as well.
If someone moved through the house or if they heard suspicious noises, they would wake while dogs would sleep right through it. Humans loved having cats around, and they seemed to get along good with dogs as well.

## These Days Cats Are Used For Companionship

They aren’t used much at all for hunting mice and rodents. There are a lot of breeds available, from the traditional alley cat to the modern exotic species (Savannahs and Bengals) to name a few.  All breeds are  have unique personalities in their own way, and will provide you with years of companionship if you take care of them.
You will have to decide if you want a kitten or adault cat, kittens are more energetic and older cats are more laid back, first lets examine the sources. If you are getting the kitten from a breeder, you’ll want to make sure that the breeder has a reputable reputation.

You’ll also want to ensure that the cattery is clean and in good shape. The kittens that are still there shouldn’t be overcrowded, and their surroundings should be clean. The litter boxes there should be kept up and both the food and water dish should be clean and full. The kittens shouldn’t be caged, instead free to run around. All cats that are there should appear healthy, with shiny coats and none of their ribs showing.
When you get your kitten, it should be used to being touched and handled. The kitten should be sweet, not afraid in the least. Kittens that have been handled young normally have a better temperament. The better breeders won’t allow their kittens to leave the nest until they are around 12 weeks old, with some waiting until the kittens are 16 weeks.

By doing this, breeders ensure that the kitten is in good cat health and his immune system has properly developed.

There’s no mistaken that cats are the best pets for todays fast paced life style. You can get a kitten from a reputable breeder, through a local newspaper, or an adoption agency. Cats can also be obtained from a local pound, I recommend rescued or shelter cats, they will really appreciate the good home you will be providing them.

No matter which way you decide to pursue, you should always make sure that he or she doesn’t have cat health problems. If you get a unhealthy cat, you will have more problems, but also more satisfaction for nursing them back to health.
