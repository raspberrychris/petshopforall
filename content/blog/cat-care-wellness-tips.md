Being human makes us special in so many ways that we forget about how animals actually feel on a humane level. Sickness is something that affects every living organism and when nothing is done about it we can find ourselves facing the unnerving claws of death. But before any illness reaches the point of being a threat to life there will always be symptoms that indicate to us the need to get urgent medical help. When it comes to cats there are cat behaviour patterns that tell us that a cat is ill.

The most effective sign of ill health in cats is sudden aggression. Even though it is an accepted fact that domestication does not completely get rid of the raw animal instinct of aggression, there are times when a cat behaves completely out of character. The best way to know if your pet is sick is when it reacts with aggression towards family members.
Rabies is not a disease that is typical of cats but sometimes there are rare occurrences. Such aggression can even go beyond the point of mere intimidation to extreme violent attacks. When any of these cat behaviour patterns have started to appear you must take the cat to a vet immediately.

The eating patterns of cats are generally spaced out and meals for cats are not at all as large as those for bigger pets like dogs. But when you notice your cat eating more than usual you should know there is something wrong. Sometimes this can be a case of abdominal worms eating away at the food your cat may have eaten.

Another cat behaviour to look out for is the unusual eating of grass. Domestic pets do not eat grass and if anything this is a sign that the cat is feeling mildly sick, perhaps suffering from an upset stomach. On noticing this you should react by refraining from feeding it whatever it ate before you saw it chewing on grass.

Illnesses affect animals in the exact same way that they affect humans. Discomfort is never something tolerable and using whatever means at our disposal we eagerly anticipate the time when we feel well again. Any pet lover must know the importance of keeping their pet happy. And when it comes to animals cat diseases can be a stressful inconvenience if you too are battling with illness. Featured in this article are a few cat illnesses and how they can be detected.

Bacterial disease is a common type of illness to both humans and animals. When bacteria builds up in a cats body it can easily trigger bacterial infections. If you feed the cat food that is spoilt or when a cat is injured bacterial diseases can very easily settle in their fragile bodies. Salmonella, TB, tetanus and feline anemia are typical bacterial diseases to watch out for.

Some cat diseases are viral. Viral diseases are generally transmitted between cats when there is an exchange of body fluid between them. So if there is a cat sick with a viral infection in your neighbourhood simple contact with it can get your cat infected. Feline viral respiratory disease, feline distemper and feline infectious peritonitis are viral diseases known to be harmful to cats. However, these are not the only ones.
Against popular belief a mosquito bite can bring about feline heartworm disease. Feline heart worm disease is spread from one cat to the next when an infected cat is bitten by a mosquito and that mosquito goes on to bite another cat. Fortunately this fatal disease can be cured or prevented by specific heartworm medication that is ideally suited for the illness your pet has.

Tick bites are also responsible for causing cat diseases. Lyme disease is a specific type of disease that is passed from animal to animal, particularly from deer and dogs. So just like the mosquito transmits heartworm disease ticks work in a similar manner.
Cat grooming can often be a challenge simply because most cats don’t like it! Cats have a natural tendency to hate water so bathing can be problematic (if not downright painful for you!). Luckily most cats actually keep their fur pretty clean so bathing isn’t something you will have to do too often.

Brushing your cat can be a bit easier as many cats simply love to be brushed. Using a metal bristle brush will make sure that you get all the stray hairs caught in your pets coat. Brushing can be done daily if your cat will let you.

Dental care is another part of cat grooming that can be challenging. Just like humans, cats can build up tarter and bacteria on their teeth. Not only is this bad for their teeth and gums but it can have adverse affects on their overall health. Therefore, brushing their teeth daily is recommended. They have special poultry flavoured toothpaste for this (you should never use human toothpaste) and cats love it. But getting a toothbrush into their mouth is a different matter! It’s best to start slowly and get your cat used to you putting something on his teeth first.

When it comes to cat grooming, it’s best to start young. If you can get your cat used to things like clipping his nails and brushing his teeth when he is a kitten it will be all that much easier for both of you!
