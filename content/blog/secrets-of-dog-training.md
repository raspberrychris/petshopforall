For those who neglect to invest more than enough good quality time with your pet, he’ll not respond to your own cues.

Walk your pet dog or even just bring your dog out for a slow-moving run. With time, your dog will begin to do your own bidding because he trusts you. This could make training him much easier. He can become receptive and responsive to your guidelines.

Dogs have not as long attention span and so they lose their ability to concentrate soon after a small amount of time. For that reason, you need to keep the length of time of the training sessions brief. In the long run, you want to help to make the training sessions enjoyable for your dog. Never turn it into a drilling session.

## Information Ought to be Consistent

Somebody gives you a collection of instructions which are totally different from what your own primary supervisor has offered. In the same way, when training your dog, you need to be regular with your training pattern. You have to use the similar forms of training, praising and reprimanding commands. If you live with all your family members, it really is absolutely essential that you just brief your household members so that almost everyone may give similar instructions sticking with the same actions. In the early levels of training, it can be ideal that you just have one instructor to train the dog so that it does not get confused.

My dog Lucky, my best friend. I was the only child and both of my parents worked since I can remember. I was not allowed to have any friends in the house and of course then, I could not understand why, so my dog Lucky and I got along fine. I taught him many tricks and he followed me whenever I went. I did not make many friends in school, so in my 18th birthday I signed up for the army. My mother could not understand why I made that decision and it was hard to say good by to my Lucky. After 4 years I came home and he just was waiting for me, because 2 weeks later my Lucky was not longer with us.

I had another dogs, but nobody could replace Lucky, he was my friend of my childhood. Having a dog should bring you joy for been part of your life as well for your family, and he needs to be loved, but dogs need training also.

Have you ever wondered how really good dog trainers come up with the techniques they use to solve behaviour problems in dogs such as excessive barking, destructive chewing, toileting in the house and jumping up on visitors? Or how top dog trainers come up with ways to train dogs in top obedience and working competitions? Apart from a few “naturals”, most really good dog trainers have a very good understanding of how dogs learn. They have adapted theory from the world of behavioural science and turned that knowledge into real-life practical skills for training dogs. This article explains in plain English some of the science and theory behind dog training, these really are secrets of the dog training professionals!
Operant Conditioning is the term that scientists use to describe what dog trainers call “training with consequences”. That is, any training that involves a consequence that either reinforces or punishes behaviour. There are 4 possible consequence types used in Operant Conditioning, and 1 non-consequence. These are:

1.	Positive Reinforcement: when we give a reward and the behaviour increases or is maintained as a result, we call this positive reinforcement (+R). e.g dog sits when asked, we give a treat. Dog learns to sit when asked in future.

2.	Negative Reinforcement: when we take something unpleasant away and the behaviour increases or is maintained as a result, we call this negative reinforcement (-R). e.g we ask dog to sit, pulling up on collar, dog sits, we release pressure from the collar. Dog learns to sit when asked in future.

3.	Positive Punishment: when we do something unpleasant and the behaviour is decreased or eliminated as a result, we call this positive punishment (+P). e.g dog goes to investigate kitchen bench for food, we make a sharp noise. Dog learns not to investigate kitchen benches for food in future.

4.	Negative Punishment: when we take away something the dog wants or enjoys and the behaviour is decreased or eliminated as a result, we call this negative punishment (-P). e.g dog plays too roughly with another more timid dog, we leash rough dog and remove the opportunity to play. Dog learns not to play too roughly in future.

5.	Extinction: when behaviour is no longer reinforced and it eventually goes away, we call this extinction. e.g dog is used to being allowed outside when he whines at the door, but is suddenly no longer allowed out when he whines. Dog learns not to whine at the door. Extinction sometimes makes the target behaviour worse before it gets better, sometimes significantly. This is known as an “extinction burst” and is usually a sign that the behaviour is about to diminish rapidly. In the current example, the dog might whine more often, more loudly, and for longer periods before learning that whining doesn’t work for him any more.

Let’s examine the terms more closely. Apart from extinction, you will notice four words that can be used in four different combinations. These are “positive”, “negative”,
“reinforcement” and “punishment” and they are technical terms that scientists use when discussing Operant Conditioning.

“Positive” means to add something. We add the reward, or add the punisher. By contrast,“Negative” means to take something away. We take away the reward, or take away the unpleasant stimulus.

“Reinforcement” is when we increase or maintain behaviour. The behaviour happens more often, more intensely, for longer periods, or it continues to happen without reducing in frequency, intensity or duration. By contrast, “Punishment” is when we decrease or eliminate behaviour using consequence. We reduce the frequency, intensity or duration of the behaviour.
A common mistake is to assume that we have reinforced or punished behaviour when in fact in future we discover that the behaviour has not actually been changed! Many dog trainers believe that praise is an effective reinforcer. It may be, for some dogs in some circumstances. The truth is we don’t know unless we see the behaviour that earned the praise increase or keep occurring in the future. The same applies to punishment. Yelling at a dog might stop it from going through your rubbish bin while you are there, but does it stop your dog going through the rubbish bin while you’re not there? Probably not. A more effective approach is to use a more secure rubbish bin, or put the rubbish bin in a place which is inaccessible to the dog.

One of the things that your dog needs to learn as early as possible is to come when it is called.

Dogs are man's best friends.
