Most dogs happen to be men’s most trustworthy friends. Having a dog as a furry companion is a really really fulfilling experience. You can expect to obtain a lot of enjoyment after you bring a dog directly into your family. Nevertheless, untrained dogs can be quite a challenge. If you would like your dog to become obedient, it is advisable to spend time coaching your dog. Listed below are three secrets to dog training.

## Developing a Rapport with Your Dogs

Many dog owners practice a teaching program almost immediately when they bring home their dogs. They discover their own efforts to become useless. The first secret to dog training is to ensure that your dog develops an affinity with you. Your dog ought to see you as a good friend, not a opponent. In the event that he is fearful of you, he’ll almost definitely distance himself from you. For those who neglect to invest more than enough good quality time with your pet, he’ll not respond to your own cues.
You must warm him under your control. Simple gestures such as trying to play together with your dog, cuddling him as well as actually talking to your pet may help strengthen the actual rapport between you and your canine. Walk your pet dog or even just bring your dog out for a slow-moving run. With time, your dog will begin to do your own bidding because he trusts you. This could make training him much easier. He can become receptive and responsive to your guidelines.

## The Time-span and Quality of the Teaching Sessions

Just because your boss made you sit through hrs of training classes does not suggest you should do the same for your adorable family pet! Dogs have not as long attention span and so they lose their ability to concentrate soon after a small amount of time. For that reason, you need to keep the length of time of the training sessions brief. In the long run, you want to help to make the training sessions enjoyable for your dog. Never turn it into a drilling session.

Loads of dog lovers in addition start a training program without knowing whatever they need to accomplish. The secret to dog training would be to constantly be sure that your dog learns a command with each procedure. Set in place one small target e.g. getting your dog to stay for 10 secs as you walk away. Work little by little.
An incredible tip in ensuring being successful in your training is to run your sessions when the dog is sharp. Performing a session promptly after he gets up could possibly be detrimental. The most ideal time to have a training procedure is whenever your pet dog is hungry.

## Information Ought to be Consistent

If you have obtained directions from distinct supervisors, it’s essential to learn how aggravating it really is. Somebody gives you a collection of instructions which are totally different from what your own primary supervisor has offered. In the same way, when training your dog, you need to be regular with your training pattern. You have to use the similar forms of training, praising and reprimanding commands. If you live with all your family members, it really is absolutely essential that you just brief your household members so that almost everyone may give similar instructions sticking with the same actions. In the early levels of training, it can be ideal that you just have one instructor to train the dog so that it does not get confused.

My dog Lucky, my best friend. I was the only child and both of my parents worked since I can remember. I was not allowed to have any friends in the house and of course then, I could not understand why, so my dog Lucky and I got along fine. I taught him many tricks and he followed me whenever I went. I did not make many friends in school, so in my 18th birthday I signed up for the army. My mother could not understand why I made that decision and it was hard to say good by to my Lucky. After 4 years I came home and he just was waiting for me, because 2 weeks later my Lucky was not longer with us.

I had another dogs, but nobody could replace Lucky, he was my friend of my childhood. Having a dog should bring you joy for been part of your life as well for your family, and he needs to be loved, but dogs need training also.

The internet is a great source to find that cutting for dog training tips for you as the owner, or for home based dog training.

Training your dog does not mean you have to break their spirit on the contrary it shows your dog how much you love him and will allow you both to get the most out of your relationship. You will learn:

* Initiating trust.* Trust training.* Giving your dog a job.
Initiating trust. If your dog has a favorite toy that he or she always seems to carry around, have this toy handy. Allow the dog play with the toy and then gently move your hand towards it, in slow and deliberate fashion while the dog is playing.
Trust training. It is important to remember that you need to trust your dog as well. If you are afraid to reach for your dog when he or she is doing certain task, you must learn to trust your dog during this time. When your dog begins training, you should see a difference in the behavior outside of the training time. Your dog will be more willing to play, and when play time is over the dog will be calm than before.
Giving your dog a job to complete helps them stay focused and gives them a way of exerting energy in a way you approve of.

Have you ever wondered how really good dog trainers come up with the techniques they use to solve behaviour problems in dogs such as excessive barking, destructive chewing, toileting in the house and jumping up on visitors? Or how top dog trainers come up with ways to train dogs in top obedience and working competitions? Apart from a few “naturals”, most really good dog trainers have a very good understanding of how dogs learn. They have adapted theory from the world of behavioural science and turned that knowledge into real-life practical skills for training dogs. This article explains in plain English some of the science and theory behind dog training, these really are secrets of the dog training professionals!
Operant Conditioning is the term that scientists use to describe what dog trainers call “training with consequences”. That is, any training that involves a consequence that either reinforces or punishes behaviour. There are 4 possible consequence types used in Operant Conditioning, and 1 non-consequence. These are:

1.	Positive Reinforcement: when we give a reward and the behaviour increases or is maintained as a result, we call this positive reinforcement (+R). e.g dog sits when asked, we give a treat. Dog learns to sit when asked in future.

2.	Negative Reinforcement: when we take something unpleasant away and the behaviour increases or is maintained as a result, we call this negative reinforcement (-R). e.g we ask dog to sit, pulling up on collar, dog sits, we release pressure from the collar. Dog learns to sit when asked in future.

3.	Positive Punishment: when we do something unpleasant and the behaviour is decreased or eliminated as a result, we call this positive punishment (+P). e.g dog goes to investigate kitchen bench for food, we make a sharp noise. Dog learns not to investigate kitchen benches for food in future.

4.	Negative Punishment: when we take away something the dog wants or enjoys and the behaviour is decreased or eliminated as a result, we call this negative punishment (-P). e.g dog plays too roughly with another more timid dog, we leash rough dog and remove the opportunity to play. Dog learns not to play too roughly in future.

5.	Extinction: when behaviour is no longer reinforced and it eventually goes away, we call this extinction. e.g dog is used to being allowed outside when he whines at the door, but is suddenly no longer allowed out when he whines. Dog learns not to whine at the door. Extinction sometimes makes the target behaviour worse before it gets better, sometimes significantly. This is known as an “extinction burst” and is usually a sign that the behaviour is about to diminish rapidly. In the current example, the dog might whine more often, more loudly, and for longer periods before learning that whining doesn’t work for him any more.

Let’s examine the terms more closely. Apart from extinction, you will notice four words that can be used in four different combinations. These are “positive”, “negative”,
“reinforcement” and “punishment” and they are technical terms that scientists use when discussing Operant Conditioning.

“Positive” means to add something. We add the reward, or add the punisher. By contrast,“Negative” means to take something away. We take away the reward, or take away the unpleasant stimulus.

“Reinforcement” is when we increase or maintain behaviour. The behaviour happens more often, more intensely, for longer periods, or it continues to happen without reducing in frequency, intensity or duration. By contrast, “Punishment” is when we decrease or eliminate behaviour using consequence. We reduce the frequency, intensity or duration of the behaviour.
A common mistake is to assume that we have reinforced or punished behaviour when in fact in future we discover that the behaviour has not actually been changed! Many dog trainers believe that praise is an effective reinforcer. It may be, for some dogs in some circumstances. The truth is we don’t know unless we see the behaviour that earned the praise increase or keep occurring in the future. The same applies to punishment. Yelling at a dog might stop it from going through your rubbish bin while you are there, but does it stop your dog going through the rubbish bin while you’re not there? Probably not. A more effective approach is to use a more secure rubbish bin, or put the rubbish bin in a place which is inaccessible to the dog.

One of the things that your dog needs to learn as early as possible is to come when it is called.

Dogs are man's best friends.

## Mirror Dog training

Dog owners have a hard time trying to train their dogs how to do various things. For example, they want to teach them the basics like taking a poop in the right place or eating at the right time. They also want to teach their dogs how to do fun things like jumping over an obstacle or pretending to be dead. This article examines one training method you can use in order to teach your dogs how to do certain things. This method is called the

## Mirror Dog Training explained

Over the past few years, we have seen various animals do some amazing stuff. For example, we have seeing water skiing squirrels and bears riding their own scooter. These examples are some amazing feats and they are usually accomplished by using a process known as ‘shaping’. This process works for animals of all kinds but it requires a lot of time and patience. It works especially well for domesticated animals like dogs and cats. If you go on Youtube then you can search up some amazing dog tricks videos. These dogs were probably trained to do those amazing tricks by utilizing the mirror dog training method.
The mirror dog training method was first developed in Hungary and it is not very well known. It is not prominent in other parts of the world where lots of families like to keep dogs. I am pretty sure the mirror dog training method would become more popular once trainers are exposed to it because it is that effective.

When you try and train a dog, it normally goes against the dog’s natural instinct. The mirror dog method however teaches the dog to use those natural instincts in order to use them in useful ways, both outside and at home. Mirror dog training also relies on the trust between the dog and its owners. It works on the premise that the dog’s emotions and behaviours will mirror those of its owners. Some of this mirror effect can occur naturally. For example, there are many domesticated dogs out there that sleeps with its back on the ground. This may seem funny at first but dogs like to adapt to certain positions in order to have a more comfortable lifestyle.

As this training method is relatively new, there are not many dog schools will utilise the mirror dog training method but keep an eye in the future once this method gets exposed to the general public.
There has been a lot of buzz lately about mirror method training for dogs. The reason for this buzz is that it is a truly amazing training system that allows people to train their dog to do rather incredible tricks.
What kind of tricks can dogs be taught? Some of the popular tricks I have seen taught with this method include:

Collecting the mail Decorating a Christmas tree Making a bed Really the list is about as endless as your imagination. But will it work with any dog? The short answer is yes, mirror method training for dogs will work well for any dog regardless of age or breed. Although some dog breeds are quicker to pick up tricks than others, this method will work for all of them.

The way that it works is simple, dogs naturally want to mirror our actions. This method encourages this tendency in dogs by rewarding them for mirroring the desired actions. Eventually a ‘clicker’ is used to reinforce the desired behavior. Teaching a dog a complex trick using this method is easy because you simple do it one step at a time and the dog will catch on to the steps amazingly quickly.
The best thing about the method is its simplicity. Any person with the right resources can quickly teach their dog to do amazing tricks like setting a table (or even clearing the table for that matter). It doesn’t take much time because it relies on the natural tendencies of your dog.

There are many benefits of clicker training your dog, here are a few to help you decide if this is the way you want to train your dog.
With clicker training your dog offers the behaviour you want, hence you will rely less on your commanding the dog, which makes for a less stressed dog and owner.
You will work and reinforce wanted behaviour with your dog, it is all positive creating a good environment for you and your dog. The dog want to work and will enjoy the training, again, the dog is working in a positive environment.
The dog is not forced into behaving in a certain way because it is following commands, it actually offers the behaviour voluntarily. You are less dependent on forcing behaviour onto your dog. The dog wants to work, therefore you do not have the risk of a bad relationship, believe me the dog will want to work with the clicker and you.
The timing of the reinforcement of wanted behaviour is crucial and the clicker being the reinforcer can really speed up the process of this reinforcement and get faster results.
It really is great fun, yes that’s right it is great fun. Once the method has ‘clicked’ (excuse the pun) as to how this training actually works, then you really will realise the potential this type of dog training has and how it can be applied in any situation, new or old for you and your dog.

Once your dog is clicker savvy, you can relay on it to want to please you and be easily trained on any new types of behaviour you want it to display.
Good luck and have fun.

Dogs are incredible animals that can be trained to do just about anything you can imagine. The secret to teaching your pet is all in the training method you use. The most incredible training method developed is a relatively recent one: mirror method dog training. Few people know about this technique, but it is the easiest and most effective technique for training a dog to accomplish complex tasks (like decorating a Christmas tree).
Mirror method dog training relies on a dog’s natural instincts, inclinations and desires. For example, dogs naturally love to fetch objects. Fetching can therefore be used as the basis for other actions, such as bringing Christmas decorations to the tree. This method of training begins with simple, natural actions and builds upon them until they gradually become quite impressive.

The reason that it is called the mirror method is because it relies on the natural tendencies of dogs to mirror the actions and emotions of their human owners. By being aware of this tendency it is possible to encourage specific behaviours in a dog with very little effort.

This method of training is just emerging into popularity, one of its greatest benefits (aside from being easy) is that not a lot of people know about it yet. This means that you can be the first amongst your friends to have a dog capable of amazing tricks without expending a great deal of effort or paying for expensive training programs. In fact, while mirror method dog training schools are not common yet, there are books and videos available that will allow you to use the method effectively.
