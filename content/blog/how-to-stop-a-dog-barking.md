## Tips To Stop Your Dog’s Excessive Barking

Canines bark for many reasons, and you are unable to stop dog barking entirely; on the other hand why would you want to stop dogs from barking when it could be desirable every so often, for example when unannounced strangers come on your property.  Which means that, your main goal must not be to stop dogs from barking, but alternatively to teach them how to control their excessive barking.  Regardless of how bad the barking dogs issue is, with the proper training you are able to stop dogs from barking excessively.

Barking can be quite a serious issue for both dog owners and their neighbours, especially when it is as a result of a dog’s natural instinct to defend its home.  Barking during the night may well keep owners awake, and territorial barking can make neighbours feel annoyed.

Stop your dog barking when it starts by clearly saying “no bark” or a similar command. It is vital that you praise and reward your pet once he has stopped barking. If you make a fuss of him while he is still barking, he will feel that barking is an appropriate behaviour.

Training your dog to stop barking on command demands persistence and a good relationship between dog and owner.  Training is vital to ensure that your dog does not bark at just anything that moves.  Training an older dog to not bark is usually more challenging, as older dogs have a tendency to be more set in their ways, nevertheless it is possible with the appropriate behaviour training.
