## How To Easily Housetrain Your Puppy

**Follow this simple five step procedure outlined to learn how to house train a puppy!**

1. The first action you will want to complete is to simply determine **where to toilet train your puppy**. It should be a convenient place where it is close enough to the door for the puppy to be able to go quickly if it has to. Then again, you don't want the spot to be too close so that guests or family will bring in anything on their shoes. Also keep in mind places that children play and that your family spends free time.

2. You have to **come up with ways to determine when the puppy needs to go** because he won’t be trained to let you know, especially at first. Eventually, he will make it through this stage and notify you, but don’t be surprised if he has to go 5 minutes after coming in, because puppies have small bladders and urinary tracts.

**Determining when is easier with these tips:**

* As soon as the puppy awakes.
* Removing your puppy from its dog bed or crate.
* When he’s awake, consider every 30 to 60 minutes, based on his age.
* When your puppy eats or drinks is a pretty sure sign of his need to go shortly after
* If the puppy gets up and starts looking around after napping or chewing on a toy.
* Sniffing the floor is a sure sign.
* If your puppy has peed or pooped in a certain spot and returned there again.
* Running around even in circles and getting excited could mean your puppy wants to go outside.
* Anytime you see him wander to the door or even look at it.
* The obvious signs-pacing, whining, or starting to squat. Keep in mind that male puppies squat like female puppies until they are 4-9 months old.

3. **Keeping an eye on your puppy**

Confining young dogs to their crates while indoors until house broken works for many. If you limit his movements, either by keeping him on a leash or by restricting him to one or two rooms, it is easier to watch the puppy for those vital signs.

Be sure you don’t get distracted or preoccupied with household tasks, because housebreaking your puppy will become a longer, more difficult task, if you don’t keep a watchful eye and realise it’s your responsibility to take him outside when he needs to go.

4. Whenever your puppy needs to go as listed in step 2, or at least every hour whichever is less, your puppy needs to be taken or directed to the same spot and teach him using the same verbal command of your choice.

• Every hour, you should quickly take him outside to the designated toilet area, but be sure you take some treats to reward the puppy each time he goes on command. Encourage him to go quickly by hurrying him along and this will also tend to jiggle his bowels and bladder, if you can get him to run to the spot you have designated. The puppy should immediately start sniffing and go quickly, once you reach the designated area.

To train your dog quickly, you need to take him out every hour and get him used to running to the right spot and going on command. 

• It is good to still use a leash even if you have a fenced in yard to take him to the selected spot as this will also train her to go while on a leash good for walks later.
• After reaching the spot stand quietly until your dog starts to go rather than staring at her. Ignore him if he acts more interested in the treat instead of going. When he does start to go, quietly (so you don’t startle him) say “go potty” or whatever cue you have decided on, just make sure it is something you can say in public and use each time, in case you are in the park or your children are around. Remember that you may have to use this elsewhere, for example if you walk the dog or take a trip.

* When your puppy has completed going outside, reward her with praise and a treat , it can mean quicker results!

Don’t just open the door and let your dog run out by himself to go potty or you might not have success in housebreaking and the whole process will take longer. You want to be sure that he relates getting a treat to going on command, so this is important to monitor and practice for the best success.

5.Keep in mind that the more time you spend playing with your young dog during the house breaking training, the faster your results will come. You don’t want to immediately put him back in the crate or ignore the puppy after you have brought him back inside, or the puppy will relate going pee to punishment when he gets back inside. You might want to take him for a walk after the puppy goes, or find other things to do with the puppy inside so that it will look forward to going outside and going pee in the designated area.

Extra rewards of praise and play will encourage him to go potty more quickly and you don’t want him to be trained to the treat, alone. For housebreaking your puppy, it is important that you add additional things to make it rewarding for puppies. Check out the tutorial online how to crate train a puppy.
