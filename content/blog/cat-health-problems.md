## Remedies For Your Cat

We all have heard our cats once in a while hack due to hairballs.  This is normal as they groom themselves and ingest hair which can collect in their stomach's.  To help your cat to have none or less hairballs, just simply brushing your cat, especially in shedding season, would help you cats health.  If your cat has hairballs regularly with brushing then you might consider food to medicines.  Always consult your Vet first before going and buying medicine.

## Fleas

Fleas are a pesky little parasite, not only for our cats but for our other animals and ourselves.  Controlling fleas is best for this cat health problem and it keeps your place clean.  It is sometimes hard to tell if your cat has fleas as they may eat them while grooming and some fleas may contain the tapeworm parasite.  Best way to see if your cat has fleas is to comb them with a flea comb.  In combing your cats you might find little black/brown pieces in their fur, that is flea fecal material or "flea dirt."  Sometimes your cat may also be allergic to the fleas saliva.  If your cat is extremely infested with fleas, with the fleas feeding on your cat, your cat may become dehydrated.  The treatment for fleas is easy, but you must kill them all and destroy all the eggs.
Here is a very good way to kill fleas as well as ticks and mosquitoes.

## Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea in cats can be from a few reasons.  Diarrhoea is a defence mechanism, it does this when it has something it doesn't like and spits it out, so it cuts water and liquid absorption.  If it doesn't get anymore of this bad intake, the diarrhoea will clear up on its own.

When you cat has diarrhoea for more than a day, you should probably help out, as your cat could become dehydrated.

Try and remember what the last 24 hours you did with your cat, was there any change in diet anything different they have tried?  We all know our cats love diary products, but try not to give them any as it is hard for them to digest.  Keep your cat hydrated, make sure there is lots of water available to them.  There are worms that can cause diarrhoea, or it could be your cats diet.  It is normal but if your cat has diarrhoea and you have tried a different diet and it has been more than a week, I would take your cat to a Vet just to be sure.

If your cat has bloody, watery or explosive diarrhoea take your cat to the vet immediately, it could be a sign of something more serious.
Below is some great anti-diarrhoea remedies and gels to medication for this cat health problem.
 
## Remedies for Roundworm

Roundworms are a common worm found in kittens and cats, there are two different species of this worm.  Both are treated the same however there is one that also infects dogs.  They look white-ish-brown, long, tend to be described as looking like spaghetti.
To determine if your cat has roundworms then look for the following, if they vomit up a worm but to be sure what type of worm bring it to a Vet.  And the other way to determine if your cat or kitten has worms is to test fecal for worm eggs especially for kittens.

Tapeworms are another intestinal parasites that are in both cats and dogs.  Sometimes segments can break off the main body and go through the stool and look like rice on the rear near the anus or the stool itself.  These segments contain eggs, once the segment dries the eggs hatch.  Look out for these small round rice looking segments.  There is a low chance that humans may get this.
