Owning a cat and treating it as a pet requires more than including your furry friend on your monthly budget. You have to be an instant parent once you become involved. You need to know as much cat health information as possible in order to know their basic needs and all there is to understand about cat health care.

First, in order for your feline companion to be happy and contented, you need to provide them a home. Yes, it can be left to wander about your own house and treat it like their kingdom. But you have to make sure that the surrounding is safe. Do not hang about things that would cause injury and further mishaps to your cats.
Second, make sure that your cat gets the necessary nutrition that it needs. To do so, you have to give them only the best kind of cat food. The best will not necessarily mean expensive. You can ask your vet for recommendations given the amount that you can allot for this purpose.

And lastly, think about your cat health care. This is so vital because if you were caught unaware of a sudden incident, you may easily lose you beloved pet just because you didn’t know what to do.

So know your cat. Observe it well. Know their usual interests, the way they eat, they way they interact with the other pets and also the people in your house. If you feel that something seems to be out of place, then call your vet immediately for advice.
So find a veterinarian nearest your place and get their contact information immediately. They are your lifeline whenever your cat’s life seems to be in danger.
You will be the first judge if something seems to be wrong with your cats. Here are some indications.

## Grooming Style

These creatures are known to be vain. They are always grooming themselves. If they are grooming too much on one side, they might be bugged by something like, yes, bug or fleas. The process may hurt them. So interrupt and act upon it.
Also beware if they are no longer cleaning up on their own. It may be a sign of depression. You also have to consult the vet about it if this happens.
Eating Style

If you know your cat very well, you will easily see if there are any changes to their eating habits. Don’t let them go through the day without eating too much. This may be a symptom to something else. So this is also a good time to call on your vet.

## The Behaviour

If your cat is friendly and it all of a sudden becomes aloof, you need to raise the alarm level. This also goes with the way your cat walks. If it seems to be doing this thing just a bit too odd, it may be something to be concerned about.
As the owner, you need to be very cautious with everything that your cat does. You have to take note of their vowel elimination. Just like humans, they may sometimes suffer from diarrhoea or the likes.

Although calling the vet is always the best choice for you to do, you can also search the web for quick solutions to minor problems. The Internet offers a vast resource for your every cat health care question. So take time to read some info and apply it on your own pets.

## Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea in cats can be from a few reasons.  Diarrhoea is a defence mechanism, it does this when it has something it doesn't like and spits it out, so it cuts water and liquid absorption.  If it doesn't get anymore of this bad intake, the diarrhoea will clear up on its own.

When you cat has diarrhoea for more than a day, you should probably help out, as your cat could become dehydrated.

Try and remember what the last 24 hours you did with your cat, was there any change in diet anything different they have tried?  We all know our cats love diary products, but try not to give them any as it is hard for them to digest.  Keep your cat hydrated, make sure there is lots of water available to them.  There are worms that can cause diarrhoea, or it could be your cats diet.  It is normal but if your cat has diarrhoea and you have tried a different diet and it has been more than a week, I would take your cat to a Vet just to be sure.

If your cat has bloody, watery or explosive diarrhoea take your cat to the vet immediately, it could be a sign of something more serious.
Below is some great anti-diarrhoea remedies and gels to medication for this cat health problem.
 
## Remedies for Roundworm

Roundworms are a common worm found in kittens and cats, there are two different species of this worm.  Both are treated the same however there is one that also infects dogs.  They look white-ish-brown, long, tend to be described as looking like spaghetti.
To determine if your cat has roundworms then look for the following, if they vomit up a worm but to be sure what type of worm bring it to a Vet.  And the other way to determine if your cat or kitten has worms is to test fecal for worm eggs especially for kittens.

Tapeworms are another intestinal parasites that are in both cats and dogs.  Sometimes segments can break off the main body and go through the stool and look like rice on the rear near the anus or the stool itself.  These segments contain eggs, once the segment dries the eggs hatch.  Look out for these small round rice looking segments.  There is a low chance that humans may get this.

## Further Cat Health Issues

Pet cat health care may be similar to caring for other pets. But such care may also have its own differences. One of them is that pet cats may suffer from a host of different diseases that other pets may not go through. Here is a list of some feline diseases that pet cats may suffer from at some point.

## Feline Distemper

This disease usually affects pet cats at a young age. Known medically as feline panleukopenia, this type of viral infection lowers down the immune defenses of young kittens by severely affecting the production of white blood cells. This infection can make young kittens pass, liquid stool with blood due to the severe hemorrhaging that happens in their small intestine.

Fever may also be expected and will lead the young kitten to become depressed and then refuse to take any food and water. It may seem to the pet owner that the cat has a temperamental personality, hence the name feline distemper. The infection actually has no effect on the cat’s personality in any way. Sadly, recovery for such conditions is very rare for a cat.

## Feline Infectious Peritonitis

This is another viral infection that is also fatal in cats. Once your pet cat shows signs of this infection, it can take years and years of trouble. This infection is usually common mostly in young adult cats and can be transmitted to other cats. There are two known types of this infection.

There is the “dry” type where the young adult cat is affected by high fever as well as problems with internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs and the intestines. With this type of infection, the cats never seem improve no matter how well the treatment is given.
There is also the “wet” type of the disease has the young adult cat having a fluid discharge within the abdomen. Occasionally the cat’s chest displays a golden and dense liquid that contains flakes within. This infection makes the cat run a high fever and would usually not eat well.

The only protection that cats can have over the disease is vaccination. But vaccines should be given to pet cats prior to any exposure to the virus or else the vaccine would not be very effective to prevent any infection.

## Feline immune Deficiency Virus

This disease is similar to the Human Immune Deficiency Virus or HIV in humans. This virus in only found in cats and is being spread mainly through a bite from an infected cat. This disease suppresses the cat’s immune system and leads the cat to be more prone to all sorts of infection. There is an intranasal vaccine available to protect cats from the FIV infection although some veterinarians are not that convinced that it can protect more effectively as compared to other vaccines.

## Feline Leukemia Virus

This virus can severely limit an infected cat’s immune system. With the affected immune system, the cat has limited ability to defend against all sorts of other infections. This virus can be spread from contact with infected cats. Many cats can become carriers of the virus for years without displaying any outside symptoms of the infection.
Cats harboring the virus may at times develop clinical signs of the infection if they undergo surgery, get injured or when they get lost outside their usual environment. These diseases may give pet owners an idea of how pet cat health care may be important to ensure that their pets live healthier and longer lives.
