Cats love to play. They particularly enjoy hunting, chasing and pouncing. It allows them to express their natural predatory behaviour. Although there are lots of fancy toys you can purchase for your cat, why not save your money and try … Read more »

## Osteoarthritis in Cats

Since cats are so clever at hiding the fact they are in pain it is difficult to detect any changes in joint discomfort. Research has shown that in x-rays of cats over the age of 12, 90% have signs of joint disease. This evidence suggests that osteoarthritis is being under-diagnosed.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. Cartilage that protects the bone wears away and leaves the bone exposed to damage. Below is a diagram of a human joint. (Couldn’t find a diagram of a cat joint). It shows the position of the cartilage around the bone.

The synovial cavity contains fluid that also has a cushioning effect to prevent damage to the joint. If there is an injury to the joint the synovial fluid and cartilage may become damaged.

Aging also has an effect on these areas. This removes the protective layers surrounding the bone and eventually the protection is lost. The bones grind together and in turn become damaged making movement painful. The ability to move is also reduced.

Once damage occurs the natural inflammatory response kicks in to try to prevent further damage and to try to maintain the correct conditions for healing to take place. But since there is no protective cartilage the inflammation continues and eventually begins to causes damage itself.

There are a number of factors that influence the onset of osteoarthritis in cats (and humans). These include genetics, injuries such as dislocation and fractures, becoming overweight, and Acromegaly which is a disease that results in too much growth hormone being released into the blood causing enlargement of body tissue.
 
## Signs and Symptoms

It is not easy to spot the signs when your cat is in pain. They are clever at minimising the discomfort so it may go unnoticed for some time. The key is to watch for behavioural changes.

## Has your cat’s mobility reduced?

Your cat may be reluctant to jump up or down from furniture. They may find it difficult to negotiate the cat flap or litter tray. Your cat may choose alternative places to sleep, somewhere that is easier to access or that has a softer surface.

## Has your cats grooming habits changed?

It may become painful to reach and groom fur. You may notice patches of matted fur.Has your cat’s temperament changed? Your cat may be reluctant to be petted or fussed especially by children. There may be a lack of interaction with the family.

## Has your cats activity level reduced?

Your cat may lose interest in going outside to play or explore. 

## Treatment

Pain killers can be used to treat the pain but they cannot be used in cats with kidney or liver problems. A blood test is usually required first to check your cat’s blood biochemistry before pain killers are prescribed.

There are a number of dietary supplements available that contain glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin and glucosamine. It is possible they may be of use in mild cases but may not be of value in extreme cases.
 
## Management of Your Cat

Managing your cat is all about making them as comfortable as possible. A warm soft bed that is easily accessible and away from noise and drafts is ideal. The litter tray may prove to be challenging so provide a low sided tray. Try to find a litter that is kinder to arthritic feet and keep the tray somewhere your cat can easily reach. You may also need to groom your cat regularly to keep their fur clean and free from knots. It may be beneficial to use a food and water bowl that is raised slightly from the floor.

## Check your cat’s claws regularly.

Since activity is reduced their claws may have a tendency to overgrow. If your cat is overweight then arthritic symptoms will be exacerbated. It may be necessary to seek advice from your vet to help reduce your cat’s weight and ease the stress on painful joints.
 
**Osteoarthritis in cats** is difficult to diagnose and relies on observations by the owner to notice behavioural changes in their pet. However once diagnosed it can be treated and managed to give your cat a much improved quality of life.
